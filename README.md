# Bank-Management

The Banking Management System is built on the concept of recording customer account information. Here, the user can perform all the tasks such as creating an account, deposit amount, withdrawal amount, check balance, take a loan and close an account. All the main functionalities of the banking system are defined within this project.

This project uses classes and file handling features of C++. In order to store all the userâ€™s data, an external file (DAT file) is created by the system, so every time we get into the system we can operate with the existing accounts. The Bank Management System is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables and strings. It provides the simplest system to manage the banking system.
