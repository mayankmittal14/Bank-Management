# Bank-Management

Bank Management System is based on a concept of recording customer’s account details. Here the user can perform all the tasks like creating an account, deposit amount, withdraw amount, check balance, take a loan and close an account. All the main features for banking system are set in this project.

This project uses classes and file handling features of C++. In order to store all the user’s data, an external file (DAT file) is created by the system, so every time we get into the system we can operate with the existing accounts. Bank Management System is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables and strings. This project provides the simplest system for managing banking system.
